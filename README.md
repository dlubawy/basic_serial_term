My practice work of making a C program to communicate with an Arduino Uno over serial.

Comm was my first attempt. It successfully opens a line of communication, but I do not receive anything properly.

Comm2 was just a copy paste job to familiarize myself with how serial communication should be properly done.

Comm3 took what I learned from comm2 and other sources to setup baudrate properly. It successfully reads data from serial now.
